## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a system for **recording heart rate data**, **archiving logs**, and **backing them up to a remote server**. The project includes three main tasks, each implemented as a shell script:

»  **Heart Rate Monitoring Script**  ╰⪼   `heart_rate_monitor.sh`
»  **Log Archival Script**  ╰⪼   `archive_log.sh`
»  **Archival and Backup Script**  ╰⪼   `backup_archives.sh`  

These scripts are part of the hospital’s system upgrade to improve patient monitoring and data management.
